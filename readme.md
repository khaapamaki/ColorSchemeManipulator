### Color Scheme Inverter

# ** WORK IN PROGRESS **

This is going to be a tiny tool for inverting color schemes from dark to light and vice versa.
Works with any text based color scheme definition file, but color codes must be
in hex format and enclosed in double quotes.

#### Example

value="#A0C0D0"

or just

="f8b0c0"

Alpha channel is supported also and currently it's using format of AARRGGBB to 
match with Visual Studio color schemes

="ff00b0c0"

### Warning 

Current implementation may change something that is not really representing colors.
This is in EXPERIMENTAL phase. Use with your own responsibility.
