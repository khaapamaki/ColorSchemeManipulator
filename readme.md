### Color Scheme Inverter

# ** WORK IN PROCESS **

This is going to be a tiny tool for inverting color schemes from dark to light and vice versa.
Works any text file based color scheme definition, but color codes must
in hex format and enclosed in double quotes.

#### Example

value="#A0C0D0"

or just

="f8b0c0"
